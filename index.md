I am Sreyan Ghosh. I am currently a 3rd year C.S. Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). At UMCP, I work under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) on *resource-efficient deep learning*. I apply my research to various problems in speech, language and audio processing.  

Previously, I served as a Deep Learning Solutions Architect at [Nvidia, Bangalore](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/). My primary work at Nvidia involved building and delivering deep learning based NLP solutions to Nvidia's customers and partners. Previous to that, I served as a Software Engineer II at [Cisco Systems, Bangalore](http://cisco.com). My primary work at Cisco involved building network assurance software systems for Cisco's Service Provider customers.  

I have been fortunate to have worked with [Prof. S. Umesh](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~umeshs/) at [Speech Lab @ Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/speech/lab/) on making self-supervised learning in speech and audio more amenable to resource-constrained scenarios (both data and compute). I have also worked with [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) at [MIDAS Labs @ IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/) on content moderation, complex named entity recognition and speech recognition systems for low-resource Indian languages and Indian-accented English.

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from [Christ University](https://christuniversity.in/) in 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I served as the Vice President and co-founder of Neuron, Christ University's first AI group focused on research and hackathons. During my undergraduate studies, I have won over 20 national and international hackathons.

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. I also [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) about my personal experiences and topics related to speech and text processing. I am always open to collaborations, and please feel free to drop me a mail!
